# Final Project for TypeScript Design Patterns Course

## Project Title: Design Patterns Application

### Objective
The objective of this project is to apply the knowledge gained throughout the course on TypeScript design patterns to create a robust and scalable application. Students will choose a design pattern or a combination of design patterns to solve a real-world problem.

### Project Overview
You will design and implement an application that utilizes at least three different design patterns covered in the course. This application can be a web application, a command-line application, or any software that demonstrates the concepts learned.

### Requirements
1. **Selection of Design Patterns**:
    - Choose at least three design patterns from the following categories:
        - Creational Patterns (e.g., Singleton, Builder, Factory)
        - Structural Patterns (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Proxy)
        - Behavioral Patterns (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command)

2. **Implementation**:
    - Implement the chosen design patterns within a TypeScript application.
    - Each pattern should be used in a context where its use is appropriate and justified.

3. **Documentation**:
    - Document the design and architecture of your application. Include descriptions of the chosen design patterns, their purpose, and how they are applied within the application.
    - Create a README file that explains how to run the application, the technologies used, and any other relevant details.

4. **Testing**:
    - Write unit tests for your application using a testing library of your choice (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
    - Ensure that the implementation of each design pattern is covered by tests, verifying functionality and expected behavior.

5. **Demonstration/Presentation**:
    - Prepare a short presentation (5-10 minutes) to demonstrate your application. This should include:
        - The problem you are solving
        - An overview of your application features
        - A brief explanation of the design patterns used and their benefits

### Submission Guidelines
- The completed project should be submitted as a GitHub repository.
- Include all source code, documentation, and instructions to run the application.
- Ensure that your GitHub repository is public and accessible to the instructor.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness: The implementation should correctly use the chosen design patterns.
- Documentation: Clarity and completeness of documentation provided.
- Testing: Quality and coverage of the tests.
- Presentation: Effectiveness in explaining the project, its goals, and the use of design patterns.

### Suggested Ideas for Projects
- A task management application that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks using a combination of design patterns.
- An e-commerce application that uses the Strategy pattern for payment methods, the Observer pattern for notifications, and the Factory pattern for product creation.
- A social media platform that applies the Singleton pattern to manage user sessions, the Decorator pattern for adding functionality to posts, and the Adapter pattern for integrating with third-party APIs.
